# Web API Deployment Challenge

Guided project for **Web API IV** module.

In this project we will learn how to deploy a Web API to `heroku`.

## Prerequisites

## Deployment to Heroku

- make the PORT dynamic. Read the port from the environment.
- provide "start" script in `package.json` that uses `node` to run the API. Heroku will run the application using `npm start`.
